# TweenService

TweenService allows you to smoothly change supported properties of an object over a specified amount of time. You can also control how the property changes using different easing styles and directions.

You can access TweenService using the `game:GetService()` function:

```lua

local TweenService = game:GetService("TweenService")

Now, let's create a simple tween that moves a part.

Getting the Part
local TweenService = game:GetService("TweenService") -- Get TweenService

local part = workspace:FindFirstChild("TweenPart")

This gets TweenService and finds a part named TweenPart inside the Workspace.

You can use any valid object that supports the properties you want to tween. You can also create an object using Instance.new.

Creating TweenInfo
local tweenInfo = TweenInfo.new(
    2,
    Enum.EasingStyle.Linear,
    Enum.EasingDirection.Out
)

TweenInfo defines how the tween behaves.

The values above specify:

2 — The duration of the tween in seconds.
Enum.EasingStyle.Linear — The easing style used by the tween.
Enum.EasingDirection.Out — The easing direction.

You can find the available easing styles and directions on the Enum page.

Creating the Tween Goal
local tweenGoal = {
    Position = Vector3.new(0, 5, 0),
    Color = Color3.fromRGB(137, 111, 255)
}

The tweenGoal table contains the properties and values that the tween will change.

In this example, the part's Position is changed to Vector3.new(0, 5, 0) and its Color is changed to the classic Vortex purple.

Other supported properties can also be tweened, such as Transparency, depending on the object and property.

Creating and Playing the Tween
local tween = TweenService:Create(part, tweenInfo, tweenGoal)

tween:Play()

TweenService:Create() creates a tween using the object, TweenInfo, and goal table defined above.

Calling tween:Play() starts the tween, smoothly applying the specified property changes over the configured duration.
